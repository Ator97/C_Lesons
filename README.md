   3. Statistics
   4. Matrix transposed
   5. Some basic roman number parsing
   6. Pascal Triangle
   7. Matrix Rotations
   8. Variance
   9. National Elections (A little more complex program)
   
2. Structures_and_unions
   1. Agenda Example
   2. Catalog Example
   3. Vowels in a text (unions)
   4. Dates Calculator
   5. A very basic sell control system
   6. A generic complex library
   7. A gneeric rational numbers library
   8. Some football ligue simulator
   9. Automata

3. Search Algorithms
